A passionate coffee lover...(or rather addicted)

I love to play board games with my kids.

I enjoy baking healthy versions of standart recipies.

Also I love to practice yoga at home and to read in bed.

I used to play musical instrument a long time ago and I liked to draw pictures with pensil.
